## Weaponry and Enchantments Additions
This mod aims to add new weapons and new enchantments!

Right now It offers many new enchantments, some vanilla removed weapons back to game and some new custom weapons!

After Updated Version 1.2.3 this mod is fully compatible with "WeaponBalancePatch version:1.4" Mod of Proboina and I highly recommend it for more interesting weapons stats and effects!

Also if you want the new daggers and armors aswell download "Knives Master" and "Armory Additions" too. I recommend them for a full weaponry experience. ;)

## Future plans-
More weapons, more legacies, more enchantments and more enchantment related diseases!

## Communication+
To report any bugs join Outward Modding Community on Discord and leave your commend on #stormcancer-workshop Channel! Thanks a lot!

## Contributors

                   Enjoy! :)
